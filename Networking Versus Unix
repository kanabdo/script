A recruiter once asked me to tell him about my understanding of networking concepts and UNIX operating systems and here is my answer:

Networking is a collection of mobile phones, computers, IoT devices, servers, mainframes, peripherals
and many other kinds of devices that are connected to each other to share the ressources. The perfect example of networking is the internet
where you can see that millions of people are connected over different platforms.

However UNIX is an OS which is developed in 1969 at AT&T. This OS is installed over millions of
devices so far. This OS supports features like multitasking, an interface to program
customize applications, multi-users, daemons, file system, networking, and many
others. Hardware for the system required for Unix is CPU, network card, memory, etc.
Actually, there are three main parts of Unix OS: file system, kernel, and shell.

Can anyone tell me what is wrong with this answer?
